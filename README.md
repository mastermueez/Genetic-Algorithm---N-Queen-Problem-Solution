## Terminology
* Chromosome: a valid arrangement of n queens on an n x n chessboard
* Gene: any one position in the chessboard
* Population: a bunch of chromosomes

## Samples
The following contains a few possible arrangements of 8 queens in an 8 x 8 standard chessboard where there are no queens in an attacking configuration:
* [6, 1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4]
* [5, 2, 6, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3]
* [4, 2, 7, 3, 6, 8, 1, 5]
* [4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 1, 3, 5]
* [5, 8, 4, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7]
* [5, 7, 1, 3, 8, 6, 4, 2]
* [4, 2, 7, 5, 1, 8, 6, 3]
* [7, 5, 3, 1, 6, 8, 2, 4]
* [5, 2, 4, 7, 3, 8, 6, 1]
* [6, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 2, 8]]
